This is the first task given based on the bash script, in the first question we were asked to print a number pattern, here nested for loop is being used. Then we were asked to rename a bunch of file into a txt file with a suffix, then we were asked to check for a if statement and print using cowsay. Then we were asked to delete files recursively.
